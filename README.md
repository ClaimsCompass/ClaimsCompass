# ClaimsCompass
Created by Andrew Xie, Derek Hyunh, Krisha Kalsi, Maryam Taj, and Pratibha Thakur, along with the help of the University of Toronto's Technology Leadership Initiative professors and teaching assistants.

A service to optimize the creditors insurance claims processing through categorizing claims by complexity and urgency, and through a dashboard allowing employees responsible for processing claims to view key details and GPT-generated claims insights at a glance.
Our dashboard-based web application provided an alternative to the existing 'Queue-based' claims processing system. It will allow Securian employees to prioritise the most urgent and complex claims which require more attention and resources while simultaneously keeping track of more straightforward claims.
